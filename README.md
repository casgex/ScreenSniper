# Screenrecorder with Python
This application is a simple and easy first project to learn python and expand my knowledge. Basics were acquired (still on it) from the Book [How to automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc).

If possible I will containerize this and use this app for other projects -> All leading to be a competent Cloud Engineer in the future.

## What does thhe app do?
This application will record your screen activities and output into a re-playable video file. No GUI is planned - maybe an add-on to this project in the future.

## Code Explanation
